# Office-Employee-Management-System
About My first project on GitHub          

This is a project on managing the details of all employees in an office.

It has four modules named- View All Employees , Add an Employee , Remove An Employee , Filter Employee

The View All Employees module shows us the details(like firstname,lastname,role,department,salary,bonus,hiredate) of all employees working in an office.

Add An Employee module helps us in adding a new employee details joined in an office recently into the office database.

Remove An Employee module helps us in removing the employee details from the office database when it is no longer needed.

Filter Employee module helps in filtering the details of employees according to their name,role and department as entered by the user accordingly.
